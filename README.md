Analysis:

The primary map visualization reveals that customers outnumber subscribers significantly in the New York City area. This observation points to the fact that the subscription model likely caters to a select population, whereas the standard customer model is more conducive to the general population.

The second story includes two in depth visualizations surrounding trip duration and demonstrates that bubscribers have significantly longer Trip Durations on average. This is related to the primary map visualization analysis because it points to the fact that while the subscription model is not conducive to all city bike users, it appears to be a more cost effective solution for riders with long rides. This furthermore points to the conclusion that users pay for the bike based on the length of their ride. The second visualization indicates those born in the late 1900s have the longest trip durations on average. In particular those born in the 1980s hive the longest average trip duration. This is likely due to demographic/ age related differences that make bike transportation ideal for customers in this age range. 

The final story is another map visualization that sought to reveal how the starting longitude and latitude are related to trip duration. While I hypothesized that stations further away from the city center would result in longer average trip durations, the visualization revealed no clear relationship between the two factors. This indicates that starting location does not have a significant impact on trip duration.
